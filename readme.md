<details>
<summary><strong>ChatGPT Prompt</strong></summary>

```
I have uploaded a ZIP file containing JSON data that describes a story. The data includes the following elements:

NPCs (Non-Player Characters):
Properties include id, name, profession, appearance, attributes, and schedule.
schedule specifies where (placeId) and when (timeStart) an NPC is located.
Connections between NPCs exist, such as through relationships or references in descriptions (data-id).
Objects:
Contain information like id, name, description, and position.
position links objects to locations (placeId) and coordinates within the location (x, y).
Locations:
Locations are defined by id, name, gridSize, description, and connections to other locations (links).
They contain objects and NPCs present at the location.
Timeline:
Events are chronologically ordered by id, order, and description.
Events:
Events have id, name, and conditions specified by type (npc, place, time).
Conditions define when and how an event is triggered.
Meta Information:
Describes the background story, central themes, and goals of the adventure.
Images:
NPCs, objects, and locations have associated images.
Relationships and Story Context:
NPCs move according to their schedule to specific locations (placeId) and interact with objects or players there.
Objects are positioned in specific locations and can be activated through events (e.g., conditions).
Events are triggered by combinations of time, location, and NPCs.
The timeline connects all elements and determines the order of events.
Task:
Analyze the ZIP file and explain the data structure and relationships between the objects so that I can ask targeted questions about the story, such as:

Where is a specific NPC at a given time?
What objects are located in a particular place?
What events can occur in a location or at a specific time?
How do the meta-information elements influence the story?
Provide me with the ability to directly focus on specific elements (e.g., an NPC or an event).
```
